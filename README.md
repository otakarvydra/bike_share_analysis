## Bike Share Analysis

This project was completed as part of the data engineering course on codecademy. 

The goal of this project is to analyze ride data of citibike bike sharing company in New Jersey/New York and weather data from Newark Airport. There are no given questions/topics that should be investigated. 

The source files for this project are csv files including the weather conditions measured on Newark Airport for each day of 2016 and a group of csv files including every ride taken in the year 2016.

The steps of the project are: 

1 - Identify areas for analysis and questions worth asking.  

2 - Clean, validate, enrich and normalize the dataset. 

3 - Create a PostgreSQL database for the data and relevant database views.

4 - Create a PowerBI dashboard presenting the results.  

It is recommended for readers of this repository to first read through the executive summary which gives a summary of the areas being investigated and the results. Each individual folder in this repository then includes materials for the individual steps and a separate README file explaining the work.
