###Bike Rental Analysis

This project was completed as part of the data engineering course on codecademy. 

The goal of this project is to analyze the usage data of citibike bike sharing company in New Jersey/New York and weather data from Newark Airport. The assignment comes with no predefined questions, it was up to me to come up with what questions are worth asking.

The steps of the project are: 

1 - Identify questions that are worth asking.  

2 - Clean, validate and process the data. 

3 - Create a PostgreSQL database for the data and relevant database views.

4 - Create a PowerBI dashboard presenting the results. 

The source files for this project are csv files including the weather conditions measured on Newark Airport for each day of 2016 and a group of csv files including every ride taken in the year 2016. 

It is recommended for readers of this repository to first read through the executive summary document which gives a brief summary of the questions that are being investigated and the results. Each individual folder in this repo then includes materials for the individual steps and a separate README file explaining the work.
